#+title: My Project Euler solutions
* What is this?
[[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] is a growing collection puzzled designed to help test and improve one's coding and mathematical skills. I had previously started solving these problems; however, I didn't have a consistent structure, or any real comments on my approach. This new branch is meant to address those issues. In particular, I will be attempting to analyse the time complexity wherever possible.

* Solutions
- [X] [[file:app/P001.hs][001]];
- [X] [[file:app/P002.hs][002]];
- [X] [[file:app/P003.hs][003]];
- [ ] [[file:app/P004.hs][004]];
- [ ] 005;
- [ ] 006;
- [ ] 007;
- [ ] 008;
- [ ] 009;
- [ ] 010;

* Posting solutions?
I believe it is seen as not in the spirit of Project Euler to post solutions online; however, it seems that there have been challenges for the first 100 problems, which I see as fair game. Maybe I won't post solutions after problem 100, but I will worry about that when I get to it.
