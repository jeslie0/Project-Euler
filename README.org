#+title: My Project Euler solutions
* What is this?
[[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] is a growing collection of puzzles, designed to help test and improve one's coding and mathematical skills. I had previously started solving these problems; however, I didn't have a consistent structure, or any real comments on my approach. This new branch is meant to address those issues. In particular, I will be attempting to analyse the time complexity wherever possible.

* Solutions

- [X] [[file:app/P003.hs][003]];
- [X] [[file:app/P004.hs][004]];
- [X] [[file:app/P005.hs][005]];
- [X] [[file:app/P006.hs][006]];
- [ ] [[file:app/P007.hs][007]];
- [ ] [[file:app/P008.hs][008]];
- [ ] [[file:app/P009.hs][009]];
- [ ] [[file:app/P010.hs][010]];

* Posting solutions?
From what I have read, it is not in the spirit of Project Euler to post solutions online. However, this is not the case for the first 100 problems, of which constructive discussion is allowed/encouraged. What I do with problem 101+ will be decided when I get closer to completing them.
